# Star Wars Battlefront III Project

This project is about porting parts from the cancled Free Radical SBWF3 to good old SWBF2.  
We will not do it 100% the same but we will try to use as many extracted assets for the  
sides as possible. Furthermore we will rebuild the SWBF3 Coruscant map.

#### Licence
You are allowed to use single assets from this mod for your own project. Make sure that you give proper credits
for the assets itself (most by free radical) and those who ported them to SWBF2 (most by thelegend and Anakin).
If you are not sure who made or ported the asset, feel free to contact us on Gametoast or here on GitHub.

You are not allowed to copy this mod or parts of it without essential changes. This means you are not permited
to take the map, or sides or the whole project at the current state and release them as your own mod. There will
be an integration pack that allows you to easily add our sides as a new era to your custom map. Please wait for
its final release.
